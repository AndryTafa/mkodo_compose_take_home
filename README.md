Thanks for considering me for this role!

I was able to complete most of the task described:

1. Parsing JSON
2. Displaying lottery draws
3. Details view for each draw
4. Implementing navigation
5. Lottery tickets list shown after draws list
6. Unit testing


Technologies used:

I decided to create a pure jetpack compose application. I was debating whether I should have used jetpack compose components
inside of Activities and Fragments, which is what I usually prefer due to wider compatibility. However I do have already some example of me using this strategy.
I also decided to use mockito for testing, and robolectric for resource loading and more.

E.g.

Thank you, and kind regards!
